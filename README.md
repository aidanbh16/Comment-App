# Comment-App
A comment creation application

## ABOUT
This project was created to further my knowledge in React. I formatted my file directory a little more clean and organized. I also tried learning how to utilize the mapping function to render list elements. Along with practicing state more. I then also learned how to use the time methods to create and constantly update the date... As I am writing this, I realized I made the comments date constantly update instead of saving it as a static variable in the state. I will need to go in and fix that if I remember. A big part of this project is also the responsive web-design I implemented. The website will stay organized no matter the size. It has 2 static formats and 1 dynamic format. It is dynamic from the full-width to a specific pixel size where it then becomes static and has a set format. Then once it reaches a small pixel size in the 600 range, It should reshape the website to fit the screen much better.

### THINGS I WILL LOOK INTO TO IMPROVE MY CURRENT SKILLS
I plan on learning how to manipulate maps better so I can eventually remove and restructure elements based on their removal.
